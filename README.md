# Beautiful Mandelbrot

A Java application that provides a user interface for 'navigating' a visualization of the Mandelbrot set.
A low-resolution image is quickly rendered in the GUI, for which the user has the option of exporting a high-resolution
version.

## Instructions

### To zoom in:
Press the "Zoom +" button, or double click or scroll up over a point on the image 

### To zoom out:
Press the "Zoom -" button, or scroll down over a point in the image

## TODOs

* Add component to GUI with instructions of how to zoom in and out 
* Allow user to select region of interest with numerical input
* Allow users to select colour scheme
* Parallelize image rendering
* Add GUI component to indicate to user rendering progress
* Write test classes
